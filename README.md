# Identify_vehicles_and_other_road_features_for_autonomous_vehicle_using_semantic_segmentation
Welcome to the "Identify Vehicles and Other Road Features for Autonomous Vehicles Using Semantic Segmentation" GitHub repository! This repository provided a comprehensive framework for identifying and segmenting vehicles and road features from raw sensor data using semantic segmentation techniques.

In the evolving landscape of autonomous vehicles, the need for precise identification of road elements is paramount. The following proposal gives a general overview of plans to design a deep-learning pipeline that can accurately recognize vehicles, roads, pedestrians, and other entities from images taken by autonomous vehicle cameras. The methodology leverages the power of semantic segmentation through deep learning to perform pixel-wise analysis of diverse road scenarios, with a focus on rapid processing. The pipeline aims to employ a vision transformer approach with a custom decoder network, drawing inspiration from both fully connected convolutional methods and vision transformer based methods. Sections 1-6 outline the proposed method, along with related work and the choice of baseline model for evaluation, while sections 7 and onward highlight more general project management elements such as ethical considerations, project planning, and team member responsibilities. Through this endeavor, the team aspires to contribute to the realm of autonomous driving by offering a robust and efficient solution for road element identification.

The pursuit of a safe and efficient driving experience for autonomous vehicles has never been more imperative as vehicles take on more and more complex navigation tasks. Our primary goal is to develop a deep-learning pipeline that can precisely identify vehicles, roads, alleys, pedestrians, and other objects through images captured by moving autonomous vehicle cameras. The significance of this project lies in averting accidents and avoiding traffic congestion by accurately identifying road conditions in advance. To achieve this, we need to perform accurate pixel-wise analysis and categorization on diverse road scenario images as fast as possible.
